# Full Road Datasets

## Feature Extraction Process
We extract two type of full road features, the **general road characteristics** and the **road segment statistics**.
The general road characteristics are attributes that refer to the road as a whole (i.e., length of the road), or general road segment statistics calculated on on metrics involving all road segments as whole (i.e., minimum, mean, maximum angle, or length)

We first extract the path for the test scenario; with this information, we can obtain metrics and features from all relevant road segments and their details.
The road segment details are used to compute the road segment statistic features
